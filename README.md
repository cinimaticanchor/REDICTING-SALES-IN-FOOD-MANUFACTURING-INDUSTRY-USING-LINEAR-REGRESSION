# REDICTING-SALES-IN-FOOD-MANUFACTURING-INDUSTRY-USING-LINEAR-REGRESSION
This Is a paper in which I had used Linear Regression on a small data set of a food manufacturing plant.

Abstract:
Food Manufacturing Industry is a Billion-dollar industry in a month more than 100,000 tonnes is produced, these 
results to more than million-dollar in sales. A manufacturer can produce in range of 1500 – 10,000 tonnes. In India 
Biscuits alone have a turnover of Rs.3000 crores. A major problem for manufacturer is to predict the sales according 
to which the production of biscuits will happen, Ordering and usage of raw materials happens on a large amount a 
single batch of production can use up-to 150 – 1000 Kg of raw materials. These manufacturers have to order these 
materials on monthly bases, with a lot these materials having low shell life and if not kept in proper conditions like 
Temperature and Humidity, can cause high hygiene problems. Using Supervised Learning algorithms like Linear 
regression and Multi Linear regression will try to predict the sales according to which manufacturer can order the raw 
materials needed. Linear regression and Multi Linear regression algorithms are popular algorithms used for predictive 
analysis and sentimental analysis.
